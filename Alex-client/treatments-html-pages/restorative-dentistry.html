                            Aesthetic and Restorative work goes hand-in-hand and is bespoke to the individual case; gone are the days when they were two separate disciplines. Now you can expect quality work that is also aesthetically pleasing.

                            Be it Root Canal Therapy, a Crown, Tooth Wear or Periodontal treatment, it amalgamates into a proposed plan and nearly all patients will require a multidisciplinary solution at some point in their lives.

                            This is the reason Dr Davies decided to invest in such a range of postgraduate courses, so that her patients would build trust and feel confident in their clinician. She welcomes those who feel they have a less than pleasing smile and works alongside her patients, lab technicians and specialised colleagues in order to get the best result possible. Currently Dr Davies does not personally place or restore implants. However, an Implant is always a treatment option when under her care and she works closely with her colleagues when referring a patient as part of a restorative case.

                            Alexandra starts with an initial consultation where she finds out as much as she can about her patient in order to understand their requirements. She checks the teeth, takes photographs, x-rays and impressions for the lab and creates a diagnostic profile of the person she has got to know.

                            The lab will discuss the case with Dr Davies and based on the patients’ issues and desired outcome, high quality materials will be individually selected. A wax up of the result will be built on the study casts and sent back to Alexandra so that she can show the patient how their teeth could look, if they decide to progress with the procedure.

                            Using this information, she will construct a treatment plan, based on the outcome the patient has requested, taking into consideration the aesthetics, function, general health and budget that has been discussed. A letter will then be sent to the patient with a detailed explanation of the plan, timescale, cost, risks and benefits. If the patients decide to go ahead, they then contact the practice and book a review with Dr Davies in order to finalise the suggested treatment, ask any outstanding questions and sign the consent forms.

                            Whether the treatment is to correct misaligned teeth, remove decay and restore the cavities, change the appearance of stained or dark teeth or completely replace missing ones, the latest technology is used. Scanning and 3D printing of Invisalign trays, rotary Nickel-Titanium files for root canal treatment and nano-particle composite filling materials all play a part in the creation of a minimally invasive, natural looking smile.

                            The treatment is then carried out in stages. Once this is concluded Dr Davies continues to care for and maintain her patients’ oral health, teaching them how to look after their new smile, whilst they enjoy using it!

                                    Dr Davies and her Nurse have been absolutely amazing. I had been avoiding coming in and ended up with extensive damage (lost fillings, broken teeth and decay). They gave me all the options for treatment including recommendations and the treatment was
                                    carried out swiftly. I have severe anxiety issues but felt at ease and trusted the staff completely. All the treatments were completed to a high standard without any issues and I felt well informed about what was to
                                    be done. During the extraction they managed to calm me down, I felt minimal pain/discomfort and was kept distracted throughout the procedure. Very happy with the end result and feeling more confident. The receptionists
                                    have also been very helpful and kind, which also helped with my anxiety! Thank you!
